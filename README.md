# Kotlin Tournament Simulator

A personal project to practice coding skills using kotlin language.

## Description

Inspired by [forrestknight's projects ideas](https://www.youtube.com/c/FKnight), i've decided
to create my own project to learn and improve my programming fundamentals in a practical way.
Using inheritance, methods, interfaces and functions concepts, i could create all logic part of program.
Besides, i used Room Database to save the important registers of the app.
The UI part of project were all made in xml.


### Executing Program

* Choose the sport you want to simulate
* Type the first and second team's name
* Click in the "play" button to generate a winner
* Save the winner.
